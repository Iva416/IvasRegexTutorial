## Regex Components

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern in a search pattern for text. Mathimatical concept of regular sets.

Litteral character Meta Character

We use expressions when we are trying to find a certain sequence of characters through a search pattern. For example if we are searching for a phone number. We can use meta character d for digit (/d/d/d-d/d/d-/d/d/d/d). We enter this into the search and use regex ._ to allow us to search for any character, . -> any character _ is a quantifier meaning 0 or more. Syntax highlighting will match those characters for you.
